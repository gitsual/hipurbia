# Destination tests

What this repository claims about a machine it has never seen, and how each
claim was checked. Every row carries exactly one status:

- **verified on author hardware**: run on the workstation this portfolio
  describes (NVIDIA, open kernel modules).
- **VM-verified**: exercised by `scripts/test-vm.sh` in the official Arch
  cloud image under QEMU/KVM with a virtio GPU, in one boot, on every
  phase tip before publication.
- **untested**: shipped as a recommendation. The code path is covered by
  the behaviour tests in `tests/cases/`, the claim is not.

A test (`tests/cases/test_destination_matrix.sh`) refuses a blank status,
an unknown status, a GPU family missing from this table, and a GPU status
that disagrees with `data/gpu-catalogue.tsv`. The author runs everything by
hand; there is no CI re-running it.
