# Hyprlang has no inline block. A block opened and closed on the same line is
# parsed as nothing and every setting inside it is dropped without a warning:
# the config still loads, the option keeps its default, and nothing on screen
# says so. It cost this desktop three settings at once. `hyprlock.conf` asked
# for the palette as its background and for the cursor to be hidden, and drew a
# black field with a cursor on it; `hyprland.conf` asked for preserve_split and
# new_on_top, and `hyprctl getoption` answered 0 to both.
#
# Only Hyprlang files are checked. CSS and rofi's rasi are different languages
# in which a one-line rule is ordinary and correct.
