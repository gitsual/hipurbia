# The palette-dependent files are committed renders: templates/ is rendered
# into dotfiles/ from data/theme.conf and Stow symlinks the result into $HOME.
# That is right for the default and useless for a choice — a stranger who picks
# another theme would change a setting and see nothing move, because the
# stylesheets on disk were rendered from a palette they did not pick.
#
# So a non-default theme is deployed the same way a machine-specific render is:
# rendered from the chosen palette and written OVER the stowed symlink, with
# the symlink recorded so choosing the default again restores it exactly.
# Nothing in the checkout is touched, which is what keeps check-theme-drift.sh
# meaningful.

#   --theme NAME   write the setting first (default: whatever is set)
#   --list         print the catalogue and exit
#   --no-reload    render only; do not tell anything to re-read its config
#
# What the caller sees change: the wallpaper, the bar, the window borders, the
# notifications, the launcher, and the terminal -- open windows included, since
# kitty re-reads its config on SIGUSR1 (which is how kitty's own
# reload_conf_in_all_kitties does it). The two that still wait for their next
# launch are hyprlock and nwg-bar, neither of which is on screen to reload.
