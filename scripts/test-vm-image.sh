# Three properties matter, and each is asserted rather than inferred. The
# credentials in the README actually work. sshd is really off, so the known
# root password is not a door left open. And two instances of the same file
# report DIFFERENT machine ids, which is the whole point of truncating it in
# the seal; if it fails, every download shares one identity.

Usage: scripts/test-vm-image.sh [--image PATH]

Boot the published image twice and accept it from its own console.
Works on any format QEMU reads, so the OVA's VMDK can be accepted too.
Overrides: VM_IMAGE_BOOT_TIMEOUT (seconds, default 180), VM_IMAGE_USER.
